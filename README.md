# fuzzy-c-means-clustering
Fuzzy C-Means (FCM) is a clustering algorithm that allows data points to belong to multiple clusters with varying degrees of membership. Unlike K-Means, where each data point is assigned to a single cluster, FCM assigns a membership probability to each point, indicating its association with different clusters.
